# 3 Idiots


To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.
This is made by team 3 Idiots, We were given SDG 4 : Quality Education Problem no 5: Build a school attendance tracker for parents.

To create this app we used diffrent tools like Firebase, FirebaseStudio, AI agents, GIT, GitHub, FlutterFlow, Anddroid Studio.

In this we added some functionalty as checking the daily attendance of the child for the parents their syllabus coverage, Assignments, Homeworks. These all functionalities comes under parent user. Some other functionalities comes under Teacher user like updating the marks and acedemic reults of the student, Updating the daily attendence, assignment scheduling, Homework giving to the students.

Except all these there are some other functionalitie like interaction between the teacher and parents throught messagings and announcements which are given out from institution to the parents aswell as teachers.

There is also the function of leave of absense which can be given out from the parents to the teachers for their child withs much more creadibilityand reasoning.

There can be several more functionalities but due to time constraints it is limited to this only.
